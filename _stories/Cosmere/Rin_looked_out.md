<span style="color:goldenrod"><span style="font-size:2em;">R</span>in</span> looked out over the open <span style="color:DodgerBlue">water</span> of the Reshi Sea. In the distance she could pick out tiny specs of rock that extended off of Rira. Much closer and much more visible were the neighbouring isles of her people. <span style="color:goldenrod">Rin</span> made a silent prayer when her gaze settled on <span style="color:pink">Relu-na</span>. To many, living across from a <span style="color:purple">Tai-na</span> (the gods that people lived upon) would seem a squandered opportunity. Why live so close to your god when you could travel across the sea and live directly with them? Why watch from afar when you could join and be one? Why watch others receive blessings and fortune when you could prosper as well?
